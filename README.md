## Algorithm\
#AIM:\
Write the program and algorithm for providing the grades of students ina class.\
#ALGORITHM:\
Step 1 : Start
Step 2 : So that anyone viewing the program briefly understands about the program put a print statement saying enter the marks out of 100.\
Step 3 : Input the maths marks in *maths*.*maths* := Entered marks.\
Step 4 : Input the physics marks in *phy*.*phy* := Entered marks.\
Step 5 : Input the chemistry marks in *chem*.*chem* := Entered marks.\
Step 6 : Input the english marks in *eng*.*eng* := Entered marks.\
Step 7 : Input the SS marks in *ss*.*ss* := Entered marks.\
Step 7 : Declare a variable pand assign *p* = (( maths + phy + chem + eng + ss )\500) * 100.\
Step 8 : Print the value of the obtained percentage i.e, print *p*.\
Step 9 : if(p>=90) print('You got 1st class marks').\
Step 10 :if((p>=70) and (p<90)) print('You got 2nd class marks').\
Step 11 :if((p>=60) and (p<70)) print('You have just passed').\
Step 12 :if(p<60) print('Sorry you have failed').\
Step 13 : End
